					<p><strong>Disputes, Including Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</strong></p>

					<ul>
						<li>You may assert claims in small claims court if your claims apply;</li>
						<li>If a claim involves the conditional license granted to you as described in the Ownership of Content and Grant of Conditional License section above, either of us may file a lawsuit in a Kenyan court and we both consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes; </li>and
						<li>In the event that the arbitration agreement in these Terms is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against us (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in a Kenyan Court and we both consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes. </li>
					</ul>
					<p>The arbitration agreement in these Terms is governed by Kenyan laws, including its procedural provisions, in all respects. This means that the Kenyan laws govern, among other things, the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration agreement and all of its provisions, including, without limitation, the class action waiver discussed below. State arbitration laws do not govern in any respect.
					This arbitration agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted, and will survive termination of these Terms. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to the extent permitted by law to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms as a court would.
					To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to: Mambo Entertainment limited Attn: Legal. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than Ksh10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, but in no event will we pay for attorneys' fees. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
					We each agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, and that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. You agree to waive any right to a jury trial or to participate in a class action. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration section will be null and void and neither of us will be entitled to arbitrate our dispute. 
					You agree that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce and will be governed by and construed in accordance with federal law to the fullest extent possible.</p>
